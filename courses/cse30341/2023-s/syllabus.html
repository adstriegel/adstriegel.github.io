<h1>Syllabus - CSE 30341 - Operating System Principles - Spring 2023</h1>

<table class="p1">
<tr>
<td>
<b>Overview</b>
</td>
<td>
An operating system is a layer of software that manages hardware resources and that provides user programs with a simple and consistent interface to the machine. In this course, we will examine the services and abstractions commonly provided by operating systems, and we will study the underlying mechanisms used to implement them. Topics include processes and threads, synchronization, cpu scheduling, deadlocks, memory management, segmentation and paging systems, storage and file systems, distributed systems, and virtualization. 
<p>
The concepts presented in class will be explored through a series of six intensive programming projects. The assignments will make use of the C programming language, which the universal language for implementing and accessing operating systems at the lowest level. The projects will give students ample practice in manipulating pointers, managing memory, invoking system services, and dealing with error conditions. Although we will offer some technical guidance on these matters, students should expect to spend significant time debugging, consulting reference materials, and revising the projects until they work properly.

<h2 class="h2">Course Objectives</h2>

The goals for each student in this course are: 

<ul>
<li>To understand the abstractions and services provided by an operating system.
<li>To understand the mechanisms and algorithms used to implement these services.
<li>To get practical experience using and implementing operating system services. 
</ul>

The course materials will test each student's achievement of these goals at several levels. For each topic in the course, students must be able to:

<ul> 
<li>Describe traditional operating system structures and algorithms. 
<li>Demonstrate in detail how they apply to various programs and data. 
<li>Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of related structures and algorithms. 
<li>Propose and evaluate a variety of improvements upon traditional methods. 
<li>Implement basic methods in a working computing system.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Milestones are smaller versions of key project concepts.</li>
<li>Milestones and projects are generally due on Fridays at 9 PM unless otherwise noted.
<li>Milestones and projects may be done in pairs. It is generally recommended to work with a partner.
<li>Grades will be recorded and shared via Canvas.
<li>Assignments will be submitted as a shared Git repository.     
<li>Inquiries about graded assignments/exams must be made within one week after the assignments are returned via Canvas.  
<li>The late policy is as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>Your submission time is the latest edit time for the particular project in your Git repository.</li>
        <li>All assignments have a five minute grace period for the due date.</li>
        <li>After the due date, the maximum achievable score will be reduced by 5% per day.</li>
    </ul>    
</ul>

The grade range for the class is as follows:

<p>
 
<table class="p1">
    <tr>
        <td></td><td></td>
        <td>94+</td><td>A</td>

        <td>84-87</td><td>B</td>        
        <td>80-84</td><td>B-</td>        
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>77-80</td><td>C+</td>        
        <td>74-77</td><td>C</td>

    </tr>
</table>

<p>
If a grade is close to the next level up, your partner evaluation is excellent, and your assignments
have been submitted on time, your grade may be rounded up.  Significant improvements and growth in performance may also
be a rationale for rounding up.    
<p>
In the event of poor class performance on a graded item, the score for that particular item may be curved.
The curve will always result in an improved score for the class, never a reduction. Any curving would be done prior to consideration of extra credit (if provided).  
<p> 

<h2>Course Policies</h2>

<h3>Diversity and Inclusion</h3>

The University of Notre Dame is committed to social justice and diversity. I share that commitment and strive to maintain a positive learning environment based on open communication, mutual respect, and non-discrimination. In this class we will not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, age, economic class, disability, veteran status, religion, sexual orientation, color or national origin. Any suggestions as to how to further such a positive and open environment will be appreciated and given serious consideration.

<h3>Honor Code</h3>

As a member of the Notre Dame community, you acknowledge that it is your responsibility to learn and abide by principles of intellectual honesty and academic integrity, and therefore you will not participate in nor tolerate academic dishonesty.

<p>

With the rise of various AI-based writing tools and the prevalence of on-line resources, a 
good rule of thumb is that if you are copy pasting significant portions of your code without
any attribution, that will run afoul of the honor code.  Those tools can help serve as guides
but submissions that do not properly attribute sources will receive a zero.  If you are unsure,
please reach out to the instructor prior to submission / usage.      

<h3>Lecture</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lecture will streamed via Zoom. Zoom information may be found via Canvas. While in-person lecture is strongly recommended, your health and safety are paramount and should take precedence.
<li>Each lecture will have an assigned reading to be completed in advance listed on the schedule. There will not be pre-review quizzes.    
<li>Lectures (live discussion) will be recorded and shared via Canvas / Panopto.  Access to the discussions will be restricted to class members.  Permission is granted only for these recordings to be used as related to the class.  It is prohibited to share live in-class recordings, student work products (e.g posts on a discussion board, written work) or communications outside the course community, except by permission.
<li>Remember, our classrooms are communities built on trust, and that our learning and teaching relies upon a shared sense of respect, integrity, and common purpose.  
<li>You are welcome to download / keep the videos or simply e-mail me (Prof. Striegel) if you need them at a later date.      
</ul>

<h3>Exams</h3>   
   
<ul>
<li>There will be two exams for the class.  
<li>The first exam (mid-term) at the midpoint of the semester prior to spring break.  The second exam (final exam) will be during finals week.
<li>Exams will be given during normal class time with a fixed amount of notes (two pages - front / back) allowed.  
</ul>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<ul>
<li>There will be six course projects of increasing complexity for the course.  The first project will serve as
a low stakes calibration to ensure proper project submission, error capture, and group logistics. Subsequent projects
will focus on critical aspects of operating systems.
<li>Each project will have an accompanying milestone.  
<li>Projects should be tested on the student machines to ensure correctness.  
<li>Projects 1-3 may be done in pairs or individually. Projects 4-6 may be done in groups of up to four. 
<li>Projects are meant to reinforce critical concepts for the course.  However, as projects can sometimes spin into
non-deterministic completion durations, guidelines and off ramps will be provided for each project.  
<li>Note that while offramps will be provided and high-level rubrics will be outlined, the specific test cases and evaluation mechanisms
will not be shared until after grading.  The reason is to encourage you to develop robust and reliable code which are
fundamental properties when coding.  
<li>Consistent git commits and documentation are essential, especially for partial credit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Office Hours</h3>

<ul>
<li>The TA e-mail alias (see above) will send an e-mail to the instructor and TAs.
<li>The departmental Slack is an excellent option for faster communications / responses. 
<li>The purpose of the instructor and TA office hours are to help you think through your code and to assist with
strategies in debugging your code.  When coming to office hours, be prepared to explain the current strategies
you have applied and particular questions or guidance that you would like help with.  
<li>Outside of major technical issues with course projects, there will be only limited help available for the projects
after 5 PM on Friday. Please plan appropriately.  
</ul>
