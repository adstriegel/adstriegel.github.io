<h1>Project 2: Processes and the Shell</h1>

<p>
<b>Due:</b> Friday, March 5th at 10 PM
</p>

<p>
<b>Estimated Time:</b> Approximately 8-10 hours
</p>


<p>
Please review the <a href="../projects-general.html">General Instructions</a> for assignments.
</p>

The goals of this project are:
<dir>
<li> To learn the relationship between the kernel, the shell, and user-level programs.
</li><li> To learn how to employ the Unix process management system calls.
</li><li> To gain more experience in rigorous error handling.
</li></dir>

<h2>Essential Requirements</h2>

You will write a program called <tt>ndshell</tt> which is capable of executing, managing, and monitoring 
user level programs.  This program will be similar in purpose and design to everyday shells 
like <b>bash</b> or <b>tcsh</b>, although the syntax will be slightly different.  
<tt>ndshell</tt> will be invoked without any arguments, and will support several different commands
that include:

<ul>
<li><b>start</b>: Start a program with the specified command-line arguments
<li><b>wait</b>: Wait for any child process to exit
<li><b>waitfor</b>: Wait for a specific child process to exit
<li><b>run</b>: Start the program and wait for it to complete (e.g. start+waitfor)
<li><b>kill</b>: Kill a particular child process
<li><b>bound</b>: Run a time-bound process limited to X seconds (e.g. start+waitfor with a time limit)
</ul>

<p>
Your program should print out a prompt like <tt>nd-shell&gt;</tt> when it is ready to accept input.  
It must read a line of input, accepting several possible commands. It should also keep track of
running processes as well as information about those processes.  
</p>

<h3>Command: <tt>start</tt></h3>

<p>
The <b>start</b> command will start another program with command line arguments, print out the 
process number of the running program, and then accept another line of input.  For example:
</p>

<pre>
ndshell&gt; start cp data.txt copy.txt
ndshell: process 256 started
ndshell&gt; 
</pre>

<h3>Command: <tt>wait</tt></h3>

<p>
The <b>wait</b> command causes the shell to wait for any child process to exit.  When this happens, 
you should indicate whether the exit was normal or abnormal, along with the exit code or signal 
number and name, respectively. Display any errors encountered.  For example:
</p>

<pre>
ndshell&gt; wait
ndshell: process 502 exited normally with status 5

ndshell&gt; wait
ndshell: process 347 exited abnormally with signal 11: Segmentation fault.

ndshell&gt; wait
ndshell: No children.
</pre>

<h3>Command: <tt>waitfor</tt></h3>

<p>
The <b>waitfor</b> command does the same thing, but waits for a <i>specific</i> child process to exit:
</p>

<pre>
ndshell&gt; waitfor 346
ndshell: process 346 exited normally with status 0

ndshell&gt; waitfor 346
ndshell: No such process.
</pre>

<h3>Command: <tt>run</tt></h3>

The <b>run</b> command should combine the behavior of <b>start</b> and <b>waitfor</b>.  <b>run</b> should 
start a program, possibly with command line arguments, wait for that particular process to finish, and 
print the exit status.  For example:

<pre>nd-shell&gt; run date
Mon Jan 19 11:51:57 EST 2009
ndshell: process 348 exited normally with status 0
</pre>

<h3>Command: <tt>kill</tt></h3>

The <b>kill</b> command kills a running child process. The shell should send the child process a <tt>SIGKILL</tt> signal, 
wait for it to exit, and then display the final status.  For example:

<pre>
ndshell&gt; start sleep 10
ndshell: process 972 started
. . .
ndshell&gt; kill 972 
ndshell: process 972 exited abnormally with signal 9: Killed.
</pre>

<h3>Command: <tt>bound</tt></h3>

Finally, <b>bound</b> takes a timeout (in seconds) and a command to run, and then executes the command in the same 
way as <b>run</b>.  However, if the command takes too long, then the shell should kill the process, wait for it to 
exit, and then display the final status.  For example:
<pre>
ndshell&gt; bound 3 sleep 10
. . .
ndshell: process 61 exceeded the time limit, killing it...
ndshell: process 61 exited abnormally with signal 9: Killed.
</pre>

<h3>Undefined Commands</h3>

After each command completes, your program must continue to print a prompt and accept another line of input.  The shell should exit with status zero if the command is <b>quit</b> or <b>exit</b> or the input reaches end-of-file.  If the user types a blank line, simply print another prompt and 
accept a new line of input.  If the user types any other command, the shell should print a reasonable error message:

<pre>
ndshell&gt; trojan ls -la
ndshell: unknown command: trojan
</pre>

<p>
To keep things simple, your shell doesn't need to deal with arbitrarily long commands.  
It must accept input lines of up to <b>1000</b> characters, 
and need handle only up to <b>100</b> distinct words on a line.

<h3>Optional Enhancement: ps</h3>

You can add a <b>ps</b> command lists all known running child processes 
including the process ID, when the process was launched, and the command for that 
particular process. For example:

<pre>
ndshell&gt; start sleep 10
ndshell: process 972 started
. . .
ndshell&gt; start sleep 10
ndshell: process 973 started
. . .
ndshell&gt; ps
== Process List (2 known processes) ==
972 02-17-21 18:03 sleep 10
973 02-17-21 18:04 sleep 10
</pre>

<h3>Optional: Non-blocking <tt>bound</tt></h3>

You can write <tt>bound</tt> to be non-blocking to a reasonable
extent, e.g. it sleeps for only a second at a time rather than for the specified
time.





</p><h2>Technical Hints</h2>

You will need to read the manual pages for the following system and library calls, and possibly others:

<pre>fork, execvp, wait, waitpid, kill, exit, signal, printf, fgets, strtok, strcmp, strsignal, atoi, chdir, getwd
</pre>

Use <tt>fgets</tt> to read one line of text after printing the prompt.  Note that if you <tt>printf</tt> 
a prompt that has no newline on the end, it will not immediately display.  Call <tt>fflush(stdout)</tt> 
to force the output.

<p>
Breaking the input line into separate word is a little tricky, but is only a few lines of code once 
you get it right.  Call <tt>strtok(line," \t\n")</tt> once to obtain the first word, and 
then <tt>strtok(0," \t\n")</tt> repeatedly to get the rest, until it returns null.  Declare an array 
of pointers <tt>char *words[100]</tt>, then, for each word found by <tt>strtok</tt>, save a pointer 
to the word in <tt>words[i]</tt>.  Keep track of the number of words as <tt>nwords</tt>, then 
set <tt>words[nwords] = 0;</tt> when you have found the last one.
</p>

<p>
Once you have broken the input line into <tt>words</tt>, you can check <tt>words[0]</tt> for the 
command name, use <tt>strcmp</tt> to check for string equality and <tt>atoi</tt> to convert a string 
to an integer.
</p>

<p>
<b>bound</b> is a little tricky, because you want the shell to stop and wait for either the time 
to expire, or the child process to exit. The trick here is to catch the <tt>SIGCHLD</tt> signal, 
which is delivered whenever a child process exits. Use <tt>signal</tt> to set up a function as a 
signal handler that gets called with <tt>SIGCHLD</tt> is delivered (see the lecture where we discussed
catching Control-C). Start the child process and go to <tt>sleep</tt>.  If the signal arrives while 
you are sleeping, the sleep system call will be interrupted and return an error indicating that.
</p>

<p>
Make sure to stop if <tt>fgets</tt> returns null, indicating end-of-file.  This allows you to run 
<tt>ndshell</tt> and read commands from a file.  For example, if you create <tt>myscript</tt> with the 
following content:

</p>

<pre>
start ls
wait
start date
wait
</pre>

Then, you can run the shell on that input like this:

<pre>
./ndshell &lt; myscript
</pre>

<h2>Testing</h2>

Make sure to test your program on a wide variety of conditions.
Try running multiple programs simultaneously.  Create some simple programs
that crash or exit with values other than zero, to make sure that <b>wait</b>
and <b>run</b> report the correct exit status.

<p>
Make sure to carefully handle all possible error conditions.  Every system 
call can fail in a number of ways.  You must cleanly handle all possible 
errors with a reasonable error message, as discussed in Project 1.  It is up to you 
to read the man pages carefully and learn what errors are possible.
</p>

<p>
Note that some combinations of commands may not be possible.  For instance,
the <tt>run</tt> command blocks by virtue of doing a <tt>start</tt> and a 
<tt>waitfor</tt> meaning that it will not be possible to run a <tt>ps</tt>. 
Similarly, you will not be able to execute a <tt>kill</tt> on something started
by <tt>run</tt>. One of your tasks is to figure out what combinations might be 
possible and what might not be possible. 
</p>



<h2>Submission</h2>

Official submission of your project should be done per the following 
<a href="../GitHub-Instructions-CSE-30341-01.pdf">instructions</a>.
The branch for this project should be <tt>project2</tt>.

<p>

In particular, your <tt>README.md</tt> file should include the following
components:

<ul>
<li>The repository from which the project is being submitted
<li>The name and e-mails of all group members
<li>A brief description of the contribution of all group members
<li>A table containing the list of commands and whether or not those commands are blocking (when used correctly)
<li>Any commentary or discussions that you wish to share (e.g. this works mostly and here is how far we got)
<li>Any optional components that you chose to implement
</ul>

<p>
Your Sakai submission should contain who you are working with and the 
official repository that you would like us to pull from for your
group submission. Pulls from the repository will start shortly after the 
official deadline. 
</p>

<p>
Note that optional components are strictly for your own enrichment and do not receive extra points.
</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

Your grade will be based on:

<ul>
<li> Correct functioning of the shell according to the specification.  (50%)
<li> Correct handling of all possible error conditions. (40%)
<li> Good coding style, including clear formatting, sensible variable names, and useful comments. (10%)
