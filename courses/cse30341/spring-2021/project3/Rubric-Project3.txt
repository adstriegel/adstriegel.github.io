Project 3 - Rubric

Note that although each project has 100 points in total, the
weight of each project differs as defined in the syllabus.

Correct Function [60 pts]

  10 pts - Proper usage of I/O thread, bounded buffer, condition variables, consumer threads 
  2 pts  - Reporting of redundancy percentage 
  2 pts  - Reporting of packet count 
  2 pts  - Reporting of packet size (total) detected
  4 pts  - Proper computation / reporting of redundancy, packet count, packet size 
             Track packets < 128 bytes, include in total
			 Correct results with single run of simple pcap files 
				Reasonable variance
  5 pts  - Proper operation with one thread (no crash, output results)
  5 pts  - Proper operation with optimal thread count (no crash, output results)
  10 pts  - Responsiveness to stating number of threads as an argument
              Operation with 1, 3, 5, 7 consumer threads   			  
  10 pts  - Stays within memory constraint (256MB) approximately 
              5 pts - stays under limit (roughly)
              3 pts - uses a significant amount of memory (> 128MB with a large file - 200MB+)
              2 pts - uses close to the limit of memory (over 200MB with a large file)			  
  10 pts  - Predictable results (run-time, redundancy, output) 
              3 pts - Repeat same file three times (Capture1, Capture 2)
              3 pts - Blend four different files 
              2 pts - Blend eight different files 
              2 pts - Same file repeated five times (large)			  
			  
			  Predictable packet count, packet size			
			  Redundancy falls within a reasonable variance

Performance [10 pts]
   
  Three runs specified by the TAs of sizeable files

  5 pts - Run-time Performance  
    Total execution time using the optimal number of threads
	Measured from starting of code to completion (exit) of code
	Score will be based on your team quartile
	  Top quartile = 5 pts, lowest quartile = 1.25 pts
	  
  5 pts - Detected redundancy
    Redundancy detected during the same runs
	Score will be based on your team quartile
      Top quartile = 5 pts, lowest quartile = 1.25 pts
	  
	Incorrect values, runs that do not stop, seg faults will receive a recorded value 
	  of 2x worst time, 0% redundancy detected
  
Robustness [10 pts]

  2 pts - Protection against malformed / missing inputs with appropriate error output
  6 pts - Protection against malformed pcap files 
            Non-pcap files 
			Pcap files where final packet is shorter than incl_len
			Pcap files with no data
  2 pts - Bad inputs / files as defined by TAs
  
Performance Testing [10 pts]

  6 pts - Reported run-time with varying numbers of threads            
			File set 1 (smaller files), different thread count
			File set 2 (larger files), different thread count
  4 pts - Reported redundancy using various file sizes / combinations
 
Documentation / Submission [20 pts]

  1 pt  - Includes a README.md file
  1 pt  - Proper use of branching with git as specified in instructions
  2 pts - All group members are identified 
  2 pts - Contributions of group members are identified 
  2 pts - Consistent git commits
  2 pts - Proper coding style / commenting
  
  4 pts - Proper description of approach to performance (README.md)
  4 pts - Proper description of approach with regards to thread safety (README.md)
  2 pts - Identification of optimal thread values (README.md)
