<h1>Syllabus - CSE 30341 - Operating System Principles</h1>

<table class="p1">
<tr>
<td>
<b>Overview</b>
</td>
<td>
An operating system is a layer of software that manages hardware resources and that provides user programs with a simple and consistent interface to the machine. In this course, we will examine the services and abstractions commonly provided by operating systems, and we will study the underlying mechanisms used to implement them. Topics include processes and threads, synchronization, cpu scheduling, deadlocks, memory management, segmentation and paging systems, storage and file systems, distributed systems, and virtualization. 
<p>
The concepts presented in class will be explored through a series of four intensive programming assignments. The assignments will make use of the C programming language, which the universal language for implementing and accessing operating systems at the lowest level. The projects will give students ample practice in manipulating pointers, managing memory, invoking system services, and dealing with error conditions. Although we will offer some technical guidance on these matters, students should expect to spend significant time debugging, consulting reference materials, and revising the projects until they work properly.

<h2 class="h2">Course Objectives</h2>

The goals for each student in this course are: 

<ul>
<li>To understand the abstractions and services provided by an operating system.
<li>To understand the mechanisms and algorithms used to implement these services.
<li>To get practical experience using and implementing operating system services. 
</ul>

The course materials will test each student's achievement of these goals at several levels. For each topic in the course, students must be able to:

<ul> 
<li>Describe traditional operating system structures and algorithms. 
<li>Demonstrate in detail how they apply to various programs and data. 
<li>Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of related structures and algorithms. 
<li>Propose and evaluate a variety of improvements upon traditional methods. 
<li>Implement basic methods in a working computing system.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Projects are generally due on Fridays at 10 PM unless otherwise listed
<li>Projects may be done in up to groups of four. It is generally recommended to work with at least a partner.
<li>Quizzes may be taken in pairs. Quizzes are due at 10 PM on Fridays and are released on Thursday at 12 PM.  
<li>There will not be a quiz the first week or on a date with a project due or other circumstances (e.g. Easter).
<li>Grades will be recorded and shared via Sakai.
<li>Assignments will be submitted as a shared Git repository.  You can use Github, BitBucket, or any other shareable repository.  If you choose to use an alternative repository format, it is up to you to confirm functionality prior to the submission deadline.    
<li>Inquiries about graded assignments/exams must be made within one week after the assignments are returned via Sakai.  
<li>By default, late assignments will be reduced by 25% per day (e.g. three days late has a maximum score of 25%).  However, given the extenuating circumstances of the spring, please reach out in the event of a late submission as soon as possible to discuss any issues.  Being proactive when possible rather than reactive generally will result in a satisfactory outcome.        
</ul>

The grade range for the class is as follows:
 
<ul>
<li>A >= 94, A- >= 90
<li>B+ >= 87, B >= 84, B- >= 80
<li>C+ >= 77, C >= 74, C- >= 70
<li>D >= 60
<li>F &#60; 60 
</ul>

There will be four extra credit opportunities that contribute to your mid-term and final exam scores. It is possible
with extra credit to score greater than 100% and such scoring will be weighted as per the particular exam. 
The due dates and extra credit opportunities are noted on the course schedule. 
<p>
If a grade is close to the next level up, reasonable extra credit has been attempted, and the partner evaluation
is excellent, your grade may be rounded up.  Significant improvements and growth in performance may also
be a rationale for rounding up.    
<p>
In the event of poor class performance on a graded item, the score for that particular item may be curved.
The curve will always result in an improved score for the class, never a reduction. Any curving would be done prior to consideration of extra credit.  
<p> 

<h2>Course Policies</h2>

<h3>Diversity and Inclusion</h3>

The University of Notre Dame is committed to social justice and diversity. I share that commitment and strive to maintain a positive learning environment based on open communication, mutual respect, and non-discrimination. In this class we will not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, age, economic class, disability, veteran status, religion, sexual orientation, color or national origin. Any suggestions as to how to further such a positive and open environment will be appreciated and given serious consideration.

<h3>Honor Code</h3>

As a member of the Notre Dame community, you acknowledge that it is your responsibility to learn and abide by principles of intellectual honesty and academic integrity, and therefore you will not participate in nor tolerate academic dishonesty.

<h3>Lecture</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lecture will be done live and will also be streamed via Zoom. Zoom information may be found via Sakai. While in-person lecture is strongly recommended, your health and safety are paramount and should take precedence.
<li>For lecture, you will select a seat at the beginning that will be your assigned seat throughout the semester for contact tracing purposes.
<li>Each lecture will have an assigned reading to be completed in advance listed on the schedule. There will not be pre-review quizzes.    
<li>Lectures (live discussion) will be recorded and shared via Sakai / Panopto.  Access to the discussions will be restricted to Sakai / Panopto / CampusWire.  Permission is granted only for these recordings to be used as related to the class.  It is prohibited to share live in-class recordings, student work products (e.g posts on a discussion board, written work) or communications outside the course community, except by permission.
<li>Remember, our classrooms are communities built on trust, and that our learning and teaching relies upon a shared sense of respect, integrity, and common purpose.  
<li>You are welcome to download / keep the videos or simply e-mail me (Prof. Striegel) if you need them at a later date.      
</ul>

<h3>Quizzes</h3>

<ul>
<li>On Fridays where there is not a project due or other circumstances, there will be a quiz assigned to be completed on Sakai.
<li>The quiz may be completed in pairs and an appropriate space will be provided to demarcate the name of your partner.
<li>Quizzes are fully open book / open note.  
</ul>

<h3>Exams</h3>   
   
<ul>
<li>There will be two exams for the class.  
<li>The first exam (mid-term) at the midpoint of the semester.  The second exam (final exam) will be during “finals” week.
<li>The exam logistics will be updated as per conditions at that point in the semester. Ideally, this will be during normal class time, completed
with a mixture of electronic and handwritten / scanned materials.  
</ul>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<ul>
<li>There will be four course projects of increasing complexity for the course.  The first project will serve as
a low stakes calibration to ensure proper project submission, error capture, and group logistics. Subsequent projects
will focus on critical aspects of operating systems.
<li>Projects should generally be done on the student machines to ensure correctness.  
<li>Projects may be done in groups of up to four students.
<li>Projects are meant to reinforce critical concepts for the course.  However, as projects can sometimes spin into
non-deterministic completion durations, guidelines and off ramps will be provided for each project.  
<li>Note that while offramps will be provided and high-level rubrics will be outlined, the specific test cases and evaluation mechanisms
will not be shared until after grading.  The reason is to encourage you to develop robust and reliable code which are
fundamental properties when coding.  
<li>The purpose of instructor and TA office hours are to help you think through your code and to assist with
strategies in debugging your code.  When coming to office hours, be prepared to explain the current strategies
you have applied and particular questions or guidance that you would like help with.  
</ul>

<h3>Office Hours</h3>

<ul>
<li>Until otherwise noted, all office hours will be held virtually. Zoom information can be found via Sakai.
<li>The TA e-mail alias (see above) will send an e-mail to the instructor and TAs.
<li>The departmental Slack is also an option but generally, CampusWire is recommended for faster assistance as well as its ability to keep a history throughout the semester.
<li>The purpose of the instructor and TA office hours are to help you think through your code and to assist with
strategies in debugging your code.  When coming to office hours, be prepared to explain the current strategies
you have applied and particular questions or guidance that you would like help with.  
<li>Outside of major technical issues with course projects, there will be only limited help available for the projects
after 5 PM on Friday. Please plan appropriately.  
</ul>


<h3>Health and Safety Protocols</h3>

In this class, as elsewhere on campus, students must comply with all University health and safety protocols, including:

<ul>
<li>Face masks that completely cover the nose and mouth will be worn by all students and instructors when in the same instructional area (e.g. classroom);
<li>Physical distancing will be maintained in all instructional spaces;
<li>Protocols for staged entry to and exit from classrooms and instructional spaces will be followed.
</ul>

We are part of a community of learning in which compassionate care for one another is part of our spiritual and social charter. Consequently, compliance with these protocols is an expectation for everyone enrolled in this course. If a student refuses to comply with the University’s health and safety protocols, the student must leave the classroom and will earn an unexcused absence for the class period and any associated assignments/assessments for the day. Persistent deviation from expected health and safety guidelines may be considered a violation of the University’s “Standards of Conduct,” as articulated in du Lac: A Guide for Student Life, and will be referred accordingly.
