<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

As part of lecture, we will briefly walk through the following concepts:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/vm-segmentation.pdf">OS3EP: Segmentation</a> - Chapter 16
<li><a href="https://multicians.org/protection.html">Rings and Protection</a>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/14_Protection.html">Rings and Protection (simpler description)</a>
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 21 - Multics
<ul>
<li>How does segmented memory differ from non-segmented memory?
<li>How are files represented in Multics?
<li>What is the relationship with pages and Multics?
<li>Describe the hierarchy of access in Multics (DBR, DS, SDW).
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Papers 21 - Multics
<ul>
<li>Why is the arrangement of Multics for files / memory so critical?
<li>How does it differ from a traditional UNIX approach?
<li>Who controls DBR, DS, SDW definitions and access?
<li>Compare and contrast a paged versus segmented approach to memory.
<li>What are ring levels and why are there different ranges for R, W, and X potentially?
<li>Can one ever execute something that one cannot read?
</ul>
</ul>
