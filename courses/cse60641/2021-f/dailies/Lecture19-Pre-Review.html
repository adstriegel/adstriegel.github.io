<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

As part of lecture, we will briefly walk through the following concepts:

<ul>
<li>None
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 22 - Superpages
<ul>
<li>Who manages TLB / page allocations? Is it hardware, software, or both?
<li>What complexities / issues come with eviction?
<li>How does a mixture of page sizes lead to fragmentation?
<li>How do promotion / demotion work with superpages?
<li>Why does a page or superpage need to be contiguous?  Why does that matter?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Papers 22 - Superpages
<ul>
<li>How is the TLB impacted by context switches for threads? Processes? Interrupts?
<li>Is virtual memory possible to do without TLBs?
<li>Why does TLB size not increase as fast as memory size has increased?
<li>How is fragmentation with superpages similar / different than fragmentation in file systems?
<li>How are extents / segments different versus page-based approaches?
<li>Could machine learning help with prediction for superpage allocations? Promotions? Demotions?
</ul>
</ul>
