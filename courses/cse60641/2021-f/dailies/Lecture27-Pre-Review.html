<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

No additional concepts required prior to class.


Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 30 - DVS and Scheduling
<ul>
<li>What is DVS?
<li>Is the relationship between clock rate and energy linear?
<li>Do most tasks use up their full comptuational allotment?
<li>What are the two key conditions necessary to support DVS and real-time?
<li>How does look-ahead RT-DVS work?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Paper 30 - DVS and Real-Time
<ul>
<li>What would a time-delay to change frequency do to scheduling?
<li>What about shared resources?
</ul>
</ul>
