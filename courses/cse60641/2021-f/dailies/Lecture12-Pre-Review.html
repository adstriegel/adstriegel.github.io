<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

As part of lecture, we will briefly walk through the following concepts:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/file-devices.pdf">OS3EP - Devices - Read / Write</a>
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 14 - RAID
<ul>
<li>What sequence of events happens on a computer system when doing a read or write from / to persistent storage?
<li>What is striping? Mirroring?
<li>What is the differences between RAID 0, RAID 1, and RAID 5?
<li>How does performance differ between RAID 0, RAID 1, and RAID 5?  Think reliability, read / write speed.
<li>What is RAID 6?
<li>What is RAID 50 / 51?
<li>What is JBOD?
</ul>
<li>Paper 15 - DiffRAID
<ul>
<li>How does the failure of a flash drive differ from a spinning disk?
<li>What impact does RAID have, specifically, RAID 5 on writes?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Both Papers
<ul>
<li>How does performance differ between RAID 5 and RAID 6?
<li>How would the more common forms of RAID impact file systems such as FFS or LFS?
<li>What is the read / write impact of a RAID 50 or 51 approach versus say RAID 5 or RAID 0 or RAID 1?
</ul>
</ul>
