<h2>How To Read The Papers</h2>

<br>When reading the papers for the class, take the following approach:

<ul>
<li>Read the abstract
<li>Think: What is the problem they are attempting to solve?
<li>Skim the paper from start to finish fairly quickly noting key sections / information
<li>Think: How are they solving this problem?
<li>Read the paper at a reasonable pace noting anything interesting
<li>Think: Did the paper solve the problem?
<li>Meet with a group and discuss the paper or raise a discussion item on Campuswire  
</ul>

<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

Before class, there will be the following materials posted:

<ul>
<li>A brief overview the day before about what we will be talking about with respect to lecture
<li>A set of general questions that can be found in the text directly
<li>A set of questions that go deeper that may not have a definitive answer but are excellent group discussion questions
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly:

<ul>
<li>Paper 1 - Nucleus
<ul>
<li>What is the difference between a program and a process?
<li>What is an external process?
<li>What is a message queue?
<li>What part handles interrupts?
</ul>
<li>Paper 2 - UNIX Timesharing
<ul>
<li>What is the difference between an image and a process?
<li>What does fork do? 
<li>What does pipe do?
<li>What does wait do?
<li>Where does the shell look for executables?
<li>How does the shell run a command?
<li>What is a core file?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Paper 1 - Nucleus
<ul>
<li>What is the difference between the message buffer and message queue? Why does it matter?
<li>What does it mean to write (a file) in Nucleus?
<li>Explain hierarchy in Nucleus.  
<li>Are buffers necessarily in the system nucleus?
</ul>
<li>Paper 2 - UNIX Timesharing
<ul>
<li>The paper notes that locks are not needed, has that held up?
<li>The paper describes fork, is that the same today as it was back then?
<li>Why does the paper specifically note the primary focus is on files?
</ul>
<li>Both Papers
<ul>
<li>Why does the distinction between code and running code matter?
<li>Is a parent process in UNIX afforded the same control as Nucleus affords parent processes?
</ul>
</ul>
