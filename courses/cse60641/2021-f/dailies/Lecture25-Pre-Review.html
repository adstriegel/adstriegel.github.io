<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

It may be worthwhile to review Multi-Level Feedback from OS3EP:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-sched-mlfq.pdf">Multi-Level Feedback Queue</a> - CPU Scheduling via OS3EP
<li><a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBFb0013863.pdf">Tutorial on Real-Time Systems</a>
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 28 - RT-Xen / Background
<ul>
<li>What does it mean to be a real-time system?
<li>What is hard real-time? soft real-time?
<li>What is EDF? RMS?
<li>What is a period in the context of real-time systems?
<li>What is a quantum? jiffy?
<li>What is SpeedStep?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Paper 28 - RT-Xen
<ul>
<li>What is the tradeoff with a lower quantum?
<li>Why would disabling SpeedStep matter?
<li>Why do the experiments share only a single core?
<li>Is an event-based approach necessarily real-time? thread-based?
<li>Is supporting hard real-time on Xen possible? Advisable?
</ul>
</ul>
