<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

As part of lecture, we will briefly walk through the following concepts:

<ul>
<li>
<li>Virtual Memory / Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs) - <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/vm-tlbs.pdf">see OS3P Chapter 19</a>
<li>Context Switching - How does the OS switch between processes?
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 3 - Exokernel
<ul>
<li>What is a TLB and what does it do?
<li>What does it mean to switch between processes (e.g. context switch)?
<li>What is file caching doing?
<li>What is the concept of secure binding?
<li>What is the concept of visible revocation?
<li>What is the concept of an abort protocol?
<li>Why is it important to perform authorization only at bind time?
<li>What is a <a href="https://techdifferences.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Microkernel-Vs-Monolithic-Kernel.jpg">microkernel</a>?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Paper 3 - Exokernel
<ul>
<li>Does appropriate hardware support exist or has it ever existed for an Exokernel?
<li>Does an exokernel target multiprogramming or is it more geared towards single application systems?
<li>Is it / should it be surprising that a well-tuned system outperforms a general purpose system?
<li>When resources are plentiful, do the exokernel improvements matter?
<li>How does the term microkernel, monolithic kernel, and exokernel relate to Nucleus and UNIX?
</ul>
</ul>
