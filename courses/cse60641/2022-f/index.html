<h1>CSE 60641 - Graduate Operating Systems - Fall 2022</h1>

This is a graduate course in the theory and practice of operating system design and implementation.  
We will examine and discuss a wide variety of technical concepts found in operating systems both current and historical.  
Topics will include storage and file systems, concurrency, memory management, virtualization, and distributed operating 
systems.  With each topic, we will study foundational work, established advanced topics, and recent research.  
The medium of the course will be the academic paper.  The paper is the primary method of communicating new results 
in science and engineering.  A secondary focus of the course will be gaining experience in carefully absorbing this 
sometimes difficult literary form.  Students will be expected to engage in discussion of assigned reading in every 
class period.
