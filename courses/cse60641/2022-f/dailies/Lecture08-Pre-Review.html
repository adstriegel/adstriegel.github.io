<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

As part of lecture, we will briefly walk through the following concepts:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~travitch/pthreads_primer.html">Barriers (aka rendezvous points)</a>
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>9 - DThreads
<ul>
<li>What is a barrier?
<li>What is copy on write?
<li>What is <a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs241/sp2014/lecture/11-MemoryMapping_annotated_sol.pdf">mmap?</a>
<li>What is a lazy commit?
<li>What is the global token?
<li>What is the concept of a twin and how is it used?
<li>What is external non-determinism?
<li>Explain Figure 3.
<li>What is a 'Heisenbug'?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>9 - DThreads
<ul>
<li>Why is diff used after the first commit?
<li>What are the KPIs for DThreads?
<li>How is success measured for DThreads?
<li>Can you measure the benefit of removing `Heisenbugs'?
<li>How much effort is required to use DThreads?
</ul>
</ul>
