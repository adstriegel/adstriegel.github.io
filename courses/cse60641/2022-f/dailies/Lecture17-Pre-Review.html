<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

As part of lecture, we will briefly walk through the following concepts:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/vm-beyondphys-policy.pdf">OS3EP: Swapping - Policies</a> - Chapter 22
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 19 - Working Set
<ul>
<li>What is the working set?
<li>What aspects of programs lend themselves to the working set?
<li>When does the working set matter?
</ul>
<li>Paper 20 - WSClock
<ul>
<li>Why is the working set hard to realize in practice?
<li>How is WSClock comparable to LRU?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Papers 19, 20 - Working Set / WSClock
<ul>
<li>How does context switching impact the concept of the working set?
<li>How is a TLB related to the working set?
<li>Does flash reduce the impact of swap policy?
<li>If we implement a lazy policy, does that remove the need for the concept of the working set?
</ul>
</ul>
