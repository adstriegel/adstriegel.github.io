<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

As part of lecture, we will briefly walk through the following concepts:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/vmm-intro.pdf">Virtual Machines - OS3EP</a>
<li><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/vm-segmentation.pdf">OS3EP: Segmentation</a> - Chapter 16
<li><a href="https://multicians.org/protection.html">Rings and Protection</a>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/14_Protection.html">Rings and Protection (simpler description)</a>
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 21 - Multics
<ul>
<li>How does segmented memory differ from non-segmented memory?
<li>How are files represented in Multics?
<li>What is the relationship with pages and Multics?
<li>Describe the hierarchy of access in Multics (DBR, DS, SDW).
</ul>
<li>Paper 24 - Survey Virtual Machines
<ul>
<li>What is a VM, VMM?  
<li>What are the major principles for virtual machines in the paper?
<li>What are the major performance issues?
<li>What are the major issues in practice?
<li>What is the difference between privileged and non-privileged instructions?  Could you give an example or at least a conceptual example of each type?
<li>What is a SVC?
<li>What does bare machine mean in the context of virtual machines?
<li>Why do certain instructions need to be trapped and simulated?
<li>How are the concerns for paging different than for I/O?
<li>What is an f-map?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Papers 21 - Multics
<ul>
<li>Why is the arrangement of Multics for files / memory so critical?
<li>How does it differ from a traditional UNIX approach?
<li>Who controls DBR, DS, SDW definitions and access?
<li>Compare and contrast a paged versus segmented approach to memory.
<li>What are ring levels and why are there different ranges for R, W, and X potentially?
<li>Can one ever execute something that one cannot read?
</ul>
<li>Papers 24 - Survey Virtual Machines
<ul>
<li>Had virtual machines finally arrived in 1974?  Why or why not?
<li>Should an OS that is in a virtual machine know that it is being virtualized?  Who do you think is right, the purists or the imprints?
<li>Is hardware changing as quickly as it was back in the 70s, 80s, and 90s?
<li>Where is an area that VMs will always struggle?  Where is an area that VMs will be better?
<li>How could a course on OS or Grad OS leverage VMs?
<li>What is the difference between a VMM and a hypervisor?
</ul>
</ul>
