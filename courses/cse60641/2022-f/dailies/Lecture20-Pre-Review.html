<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

As part of lecture, we will briefly walk through the following concepts:

<ul>
<li>None
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 23 - Clustered Memory
<ul>
<li>What is a local page? Global page?
<li>What is NUMA?
<li>What is the weight for a node in the cluster and how is it assigned?
<li>What is the epoch and what role does it play?
<li>What is the general eviction strategy?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Papers 23 - Clustered Memory
<ul>
<li>How does the working set relate to the approach of the paper?
<li>How would flash as a disk impact the tradeoffs?
<li>Would the approach in the paper still be useful today?
<li>What are workloads that would fare well in this scheme? What might fare poorly?
</ul>
</ul>
