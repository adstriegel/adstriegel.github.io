<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

As part of lecture, we will briefly walk through the following concepts:

<ul>
<li>Condition Variables - <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-cv.pdf">see OS3P Chapter 30</a>
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 6 - Events Bad Idea
<ul>
<li>What does it mean to block or yield in a thread?  What is the difference?
<li>What is cooperative multi-tasking? What is pre-emption? How are they different?
<li>What does it mean to "call" by sending an event? How does a "return" work for events?
<li>Is there a call-stack for events?  
</ul>
<li>Paper 7 - SEDA
<ul>
<li>What is a stage in SEDA?
<li>What is a queue in SEDA?
<li>What is a well-conditioned service?
<li>What is introspection?
<li>What is the purpose of self-tuning in SEDA?
<li>How are threads and stages related?
<li>How is the number of threads in a stage controlled?
<li>Where does batching come in and why is it potentially helpful?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>6 - Events are a Bad Idea
<ul>
<li>What does it mean to just fix events?  Is it tantamount to switching to threads?
<li>Why does the Duality paper helpful as discussed?
<li>Are complicated patterns useful / helpful or are they largely academic exercises (Page 21)?
<li>Will we ever get better synchronization help from the compiler or via run-time analysis?  How big of a help will it be?
</ul>
<li>7 - SEDA
<ul>
<li>Why can multiple threads be assigned to a stage?
<li>Why do events scale differently than threads?
<li>Is it scalability that limited the usage of threads (as SEDA argues) or the difficult in using them (as Ousterhout argues)?
<li>Why is it important that the file being loaded in the scalability demo (threads vs. events) is already in the cache?
</ul>
<li>Both Papers
<ul>
<li>Has your opinion changed on who is right on events versus threads? Why?
</ul>
</ul>
