<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

If you did not have a chance prior to the Goldberg paper, it may be worthwhile to review the OS3EP chapter on Virtual Machines:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/vmm-intro.pdf">Virtual Machines - OS3EP</a>
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 25 - VMMs - Current and Future Trends
<ul>
<li>What is a Type 1 VM? Type 2?
<li>What is a guest operating system?
<li>What is encapsulation?
<li>What is total mediation?
<li>What does the POPF instruction do?
<li>What is paravirtualization?
<li>What is a trace cache?
<li>What is a shadow page table?
<li>What is a balloon process?
</ul>
<li>Paper 26 - Architecture Virtual Machines
<ul>
<li>What do the following terms mean: ISA, ABI, API?
<li>What is a process virtual machine?
<li>What is interpretation? What is dynamic binary translation?
<li>What is HLL?
<li>What is physical partioning versus logical partioning?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Both Papers
<ul>
<li>Why might migration be an important feature of a virtual machine?
<li>How is the shadow page table similar or different versus twinning with DThreads?
<li>Could a VM provide determinism ala DThreads?
<li>How could VMWare catch and translate a block prior to execution? What mechanism courtesy of the hardware and software help assist with that approach?
<li>What is more important, isolation or resource sharing?
</ul>
</ul>
