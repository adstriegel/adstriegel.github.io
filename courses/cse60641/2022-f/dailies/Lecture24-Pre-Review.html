<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

If you did not have a chance prior to the Goldberg paper, it may be worthwhile to review the OS3EP chapter on Virtual Machines:

<ul>
<li>None
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 27 - Xen
<ul>
<li>What is Xen's definition of paravirtualization?
<li>How does the x86 handle TLB misses?
<li>What is a hypercall?
<li>What is a domain?
<li>What is domain 0?
<li>How many ring levels does the x86 have?
<li>What is an I/O ring?
<li>How are page tables handled in Xen?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Paper 27 - Xen
<ul>
<li>Why is time potentially problematic with a VM?
<li>Why is meeting time constraints hard with a VM?
<li>Recall the purist / impurist discussion from Goldberg. Now having read several papers, who is right?  Why?
<li>What are the major differences and similarities between the VMWare approach and Xen?
</ul>
</ul>
