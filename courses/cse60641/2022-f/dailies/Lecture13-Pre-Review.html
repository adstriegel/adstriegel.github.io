<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

As part of lecture, we will briefly walk through the following concepts:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/dist-nfs.pdf">OS3EP - NFS</a>
<li><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/dist-afs.pdf">OS3EP - AFS</a>
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 16 - AFS
<ul>
<li>What is Venus? What is Vice?
<li>What is a callback in the context of AFS?
<li>When are changes propagated to the server?
<li>When is the status of a file checked?
<li>What is a cold cache? Warm cache?
<li>How does AFS compare to NFS?
<li>What is a volume in AFS?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Paper 16 - AFS
<ul>
<li>Can files become de-synchronized with AFS still?
<li>AFS also provides improves ACL (Access Control Lists).  What are the improvements to ACLs in AFS and why are they helpful?
<li>If a system crashes or restarts, how does that impact AFS?
<li>Does AFS preserve POSIX compliance from a file system perspective?
<li>What would an invocation of an open file under AFS do? How would that contrast with NFS?
</ul>
</ul>
