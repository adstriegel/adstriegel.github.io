<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

As part of lecture, we will briefly walk through the following concepts:

<ul>
<li>pThreads - Brief Overview - <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-api.pdf">see OS3P Chapter 27</a>
<ul>
<li>Write simple threaded code in C
<li>Function Pointers in C / C++
<li>Typecasting in C / C++
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 4 - Lightweight Processes
<ul>
<li>What is a kernel thread versus a user thread?  See <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.1?topic=processes-kernel-threads-user-threads">here</a>
<li>What do threads share?
<li>What is separate for each thread?
<li>What does the OS actually schedule?  
<li>What are the key states of threads versus LWPs?
</ul>
<li>Paper 5 - Threads are a Bad Idea
<ul>
<li>What is a race condition?
<li>What is deadlock?
<li>Why is debugging threads hard?
<li>How does event-based programming differ from thread-based programming?
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Lightweight Threads
<ul>
<li>What is the right number of kernel threads?  
</ul>
<li>Both Papers
<ul>
<li>What does it mean for a library function to be thread safe?
<li>Who provides support for concurrency primitives (e.g. mutexes)?
<li>What does the OS actually see when scheduling?
<li>Who is right?
</ul>
</ul>
