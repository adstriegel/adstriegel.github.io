<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

As part of lecture, we will briefly walk through the following concepts:

<ul>
<li>Mid-Term - Take Home Clarifications
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 18 - Google FS
<ul>
<li>What are the four major design differences espoused by GFS?
<li>What does immutable mean?
<li>What is a chunk?
<li>How are chunks tracked if at all?
<li>What does relaxed consistency mean?
<li>Are aliases supported in GFS?
<li>How does replication happen?
<li>How is garbage collection handled?
<li>What is a "shadow" master?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Paper 18 - GoogleFS
<ul>
<li>Are the design points raised by GFS that radical?
<li>How are chunks different from objects if at all?
<li>Are the right KPIs evaluated?
</ul>
</ul>
