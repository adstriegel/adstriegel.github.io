<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 27 - Xen
<ul>
<li>What is Xen's definition of paravirtualization?
<li>How does the x86 handle TLB misses?
<li>What is a hypercall?
<li>What is a domain?
<li>What is domain 0?
<li>How many ring levels does the x86 have?
<li>What is an I/O ring?
<li>How are page tables handled in Xen?
</ul>
<li>Paper 28 - RT-Xen / Background
<ul>
<li>What does it mean to be a real-time system?
<li>What is hard real-time? soft real-time?
<li>What is EDF? RMS?
<li>What is a period in the context of real-time systems?
<li>What is a quantum? jiffy?
<li>What is SpeedStep?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Paper 27 - Xen
<ul>
<li>Why is time potentially problematic with a VM?
<li>Why is meeting time constraints hard with a VM?
<li>Recall the purist / impurist discussion from Goldberg. Now having read several papers, who is right?  Why?
<li>What are the major differences and similarities between the VMWare approach and Xen?
</ul>
<li>Paper 28 - RT-Xen
<ul>
<li>What is the tradeoff with a lower quantum?
<li>Why would disabling SpeedStep matter?
<li>Why do the experiments share only a single core?
<li>Is an event-based approach necessarily real-time? thread-based?
<li>Is supporting hard real-time on Xen possible? Advisable?
</ul>
</ul>
