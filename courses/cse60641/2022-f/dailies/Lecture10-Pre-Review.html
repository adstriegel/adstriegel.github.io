<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

As part of lecture, we will briefly walk through the following concepts:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/file-lfs.pdf">OS3EP: Log-based File System</a>
<li><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/file-ssd.pdf">OS3EP: Flash (SSD)</a>
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 11 - LFS
<ul>
<li>What is an extent?
<li>What is NVRAM?
<li>What are segments? What is segment cleaning?
<li>Why is a right shift better in Figures 3 and 4?
<li>What is a checkpoint?
</ul>
<li>Paper 12 - F2FS
<ul>
<li>What is EXT4?
<li>What is SQLite?
<li>What is a segment? section? zone?
<li>What does fsync do?
<li>What is the KPI for F2FS?
<li>What is interesting about the varmail benchmark?
<li>What is WAF?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Paper 11 - LFS
<ul>
<li>How is LFS related to journaling (see journaling under OS3EP)?
<li>Is the small-file workload realistic? Why or why not?
<li>Did LFS offer significantly improved performance? Why or why not?
</ul>
<li>Paper 12 - F2FS
<ul>
<li>Why does LFS improve performance on random writes?
<li>What does the use of a hash mean for wildcard or partial searches?
<li>Why does knowing write-once / read-only matter?
</ul>
</ul>
