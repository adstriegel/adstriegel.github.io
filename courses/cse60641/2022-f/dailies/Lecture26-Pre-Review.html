<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

We will review the following concepts in class:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-sched-mlfq.pdf">Multi-Level Feedback Queue</a> - CPU Scheduling via OS3EP
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 29 - RMS vs. EDF
<ul>
<li>What is latency?
<li>What is jitter?
<li>What does it mean to say priorities are inversely proportional to the absolute deadline for EDF?
<li>What does it mean to have an overload situation?
<li>What does it mean for something to be transient?
<li>What is priority inversion? Why does it matter?
<li>What is an aperiodic task? Can you give an example?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Paper 29 - RMS vs. EDF
<ul>
<li>Is jitter important for all real-time systems?
<li>Should a real-time task be stopped when it exceeds its allocated time?
<li>Can pre-emption happen in an EDF system? What about RMS? Why?
</ul>
</ul>
