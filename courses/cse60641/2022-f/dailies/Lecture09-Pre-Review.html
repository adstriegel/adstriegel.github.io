<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

As part of lecture, we will briefly walk through the following concepts:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/file-implementation.pdf">OS3EP: File System Implementation (inodes)</a>
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 10 - Fast File System
<ul>
<li>What is the PDP-11? What are its specifications?
<li>What is a VAX system?
<li>How does the disk speed in the paper compare with modern disk speeds?
<li>What are the main components of a "spinning" disk?
<li>What is a partition? Superblock? inode?
<li>What is a directory? How is it represented in an inode-based file system?
<li>What is an indirect pointer? Direct pointer? 
<li>What are the typical levels of indirection?
<li>What is a cylinder group?
<li>What is the block size? Why does it matter?
<li>What is locality?
<li>How many accesses are required to do: cat /home/striegel/hello.txt
<li>How does an advisory lock differ from a hard lock?
<li>What is symbolic link?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Paper 10 - Fast File System
<ul>
<li>Is the "waste" from small files that much of a problem today?
<li>What is the "right" size of a fragment? How does fragment size impact performance and waste?
<li>What happens when the disk gets mostly full?
</ul>
</ul>
