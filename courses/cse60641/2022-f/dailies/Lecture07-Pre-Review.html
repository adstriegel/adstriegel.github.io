<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

As part of lecture, we will briefly walk through the following concepts:

<ul>
<li>Bounded Buffer via Semaphores - <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-sema.pdf">OS 3EP - Chapter 31</a>
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>8 - Monitors
<ul>
<li>In the context of a semaphore, what does P mean? What does V mean?
<li>Do monitors have order in their request queue? 
<li>Why must acquisition of a lock be atomic?
<li>What is a bounded buffer? What is a producer? What is a consumer?
<li>How would a "ring" buffer work with a read and write pointer (e.g. fixed array that wraps)?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>8 - Monitors
<ul>
<li>Did the paper prove that semaphores can be implemented by monitors?
<li>How would you relate semaphores versus monitors?
<li>How would you relate monitors and condition variables?
<li>Why is the urgent queue needed?
<li>How relevant are the closing thoughts in the conclusions?
</ul>
</ul>
