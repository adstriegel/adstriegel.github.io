<h2>Pre-Review Notes</h2>

As part of lecture, we will briefly walk through the following concepts:

<ul>
<li>None outside of the paper
</ul>

Consider the following questions that can be found in the papers directly or reading background materials:

<ul>
<li>Paper 12 - Flash-based File System
<ul>
<li>See the <a href="Lecture10-Pre-Review.html">pre-review for last Thursday</a>
</ul>
<li>Paper 13 - Reliability
<ul>
<li>What is a fault? error? failure? How do they differ from one another?
<li>What is the purpose of redundancy? How might it differ in hardware and software variations?
<li>What is error detection? error correction?
<li>What is reliability?
<li>What is MTTF? MTBF? MTRF? How are they related?
<li>What is TMR?
</ul>
</ul>

Consider the following questions in a group or by yourself (see above):

<ul>
<li>Paper 13 - Reliability
<ul>
<li>Does a fault always result in an error?
<li>Is there an error always before a failure?
<li>What is the relationship between the number of components and reliability? What aspects might change that relationship?
<li>How is availability different from reliability?  Could you think of an example?
<li>How might pro-active versus reactive fault tolerance differ?
<li>Are systems that mask faults necessarily less reliable than systems that actively detect faults?
</ul>
</ul>
